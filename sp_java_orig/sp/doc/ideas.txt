Have a MP stat, with actions decreasing it and ends of turns (for RTS
in the long run) increasing it by the value of the speed stat.
Attacking, bombarding, and moving all subtract from MP. Have a maxMP
stat to prevent silliness.

Rather than having players get resources from only those tiles their
units are on, implement a "control of" property. To take control of a
tile, a unit stands on or next to it at the end of that player's turn.
(Since resources are allocated at the beginning of the player's turn,
this makes contested ground worthless to both sides.) Units and
buildings can also only be built on ground the player owns.
