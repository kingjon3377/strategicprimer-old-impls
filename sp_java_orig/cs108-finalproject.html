    <h1>My Final Project</h1>

    <br><br>Jonathan Lovelace, CS 108, Fall, 2006

    <br><br>My final project is a strategy game of my own design ... sort of a
	prototype for the overarching game that I intend to develop when I'm a
	much better programmer. You can find it <a
	href="finalproject.jar">here</a>. (MD5SUM 0664eef5e47e1b2a91f6c030d160a307 )
	(You will need the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) from 
	<a href="http://java.com/en/">java.com</a> (or the Java SDK from <a
	href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>) to run.)

    <br><br>A description, taken from the comments in the main files of the model and the view:
    <br><pre> Strategic Primer/Yudexen (the first is my name for the game this
	will hopefully eventually become, which I began designing but had never
	created a successful even partial implementation of until now; the
	second is the name of the game into which I put quite a bit of effort
	in the Spring 2006 semester in <a href="http://csx.calvin.edu">CSX</a>,
	and of which I am now the maintainer due to lack of constinued interest
	from the rest of CSX -- consider it a fork of Strategic Primer's
	design) is a strategy game (turn-based for now; likely 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">RTS</a> at
	some time in the future). This project is a prototype of some parts of
	it.</pre>


    <br><br>Here's what it looks like: <br><img src="final.png">

    <br><br>If you have any questions about this assignment, you can see the
    specification at <a
href="http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/108/kvlinden/private/project/project.php">project.php</a>.

    <br><br><h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <br><br>This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy">turn-based strategy</a>
	game, which uses a mode-based click-and-click interface. Nearly
	everything in the interface except the map itself has tooltips that pop
	up if you hold your mouse over one of them. Click on a button at the
	top to set the mode, then click one or two tiles (depending on the
	mode) on the map to set where to apply the action. If the action is
	building, select what to build after you select the tile to build on.

    <br><br>The orange and black circles on the map represent units; use the
	Info mode to inspect them. Black units belong to player #1, while
	orange units belong to player #2.
