This "project" combines several mostly-old-and-bitrotted projects I've worked
on, that I'd like to draw from in creating the computer version of my strategy
game Strategic Primer.

Yudexen is a C++ strategy game begun by the CSX club at Calvin College the
spring of 2006, which I then adopted. Highly incomplete.

from_c_code contains several old, old C implementations of SP that I tried to
translate to Java.

sp_java_orig contains some of the "original" Java SP implementations.

sp_java_next contains my next attempt at a SP implementation in Java.

And sp-ng contains the most recent attempt.
